Be sure you are logged into github with your Seven Hills Email account.

**YOU SHOULD SPEND ABOUT AN HOUR ON THIS PART OF THE ASSIGNMENT 
1.	In the top right corner of the screen, look for the “Fork” button.  This should create a copy of the project in your GitHub folders and allow you to create versions of your assignment.
2.	Type the version of your code from class – you can type in any plain editor, word doc, etc.
a.	DO NOT MAKE CHANGES to your code YET.
b.	DO NOT COMPILE OR TRY TO EXECUTE OR RUN – I want a typed version of your work.
c.	Be sure you create version of Kiosk.java and Printer.java
d.	Save/Commit those changes to your GitHub project
e.	**IN THE COMMENTS NOTE THE TIME IT TOOK TO TYPE YOUR PROJECT** add in the comments
f.	IF you are unsure of how to save correctly to GitHub, email the type version of your code from class, and email the two files to yourself.
g.	RESIST the urge to correct or compile at this point.
3.	Next, open your typed code in an editor and begin to test and debug your project.
a.	Spend a reasonable amount of time on typing and debugging/continuing to code. (~1hr)
b.	So – if it took you 20minutes to type in the first part, spend about 30 min debugging and continuing to work on improving your project. (You will need ~10 min for the final part)
c.	AFTER about 1 hour – you may stop.  You can continue working – but should not be staying up all night to do this.  You are graded on process not product.
4.	Save your code to the GitHub project that you forked.
a.	*******************************************
b.	In the comments of saving this commit (doesn’t have to be final or finished yet)
c.	**DESCRIBE the process so far describe, at length if needed – how you approached this problem and how you spent time deciding what to do and how to build
d.	*** Give this part of the assignment 10 minutes of a writeup (set a timer if needed)



FINAL CHECKS:  This is a multipoint assignment – first the inclass quiz, second, converting and debugging, and third the reflection (posted as a comment in your 2nd (or later) commit.  

Be sure you have read instructions carefully and followed directions.
